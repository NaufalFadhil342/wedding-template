Wedding Template

This website built by React as a frontend framework include React Hook, React Router Dom v6, React Icons, React Scroll, and Embla Carousel. I use React because this framework is open source, therefore many libraries can use with React. Next, using React Router Dom for navigate is easily to used rather than made it manually. Next, React Icons is a library that used to add icon to my website. React Scroll is used to make navigate link to the landing page with scrolling effect. The last is Embla Carousel, this library worth for any website to make a hero or something else carousel effect for make the website good look.
